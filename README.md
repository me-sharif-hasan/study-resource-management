# iiStudy - your online class resource manager
This project for those busy/ lazy university student who struggle to do some note in the class/ loose them in the void. Traditional solution of this problem is to use windows explorer/ explorer apps from other os but file management is hard their. I come up with this solution to take all study related works a student have to done in one place, so they can be more focused and their materials and organized in a good manner.
